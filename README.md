# Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on segmenting customers based on purchasing behavior and demographic attributes to enable data-driven marketing and business decision-making. Python-based analysis and clustering techniques are used to identify distinct customer groups.

## 🎯 Objective
- Analyze customer purchase behavior and attributes  
- Segment customers into meaningful groups using clustering  
- Provide actionable insights for targeted marketing and retention strategies  

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Machine Learning: K-Means Clustering (scikit-learn)

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset contains customer-level information such as:
- Purchase Amount (USD)
- Age
- Review Rating
- Previous Purchases
- Product Category
- Season and Location
- Discount Applied (Yes/No)

## 🔍 Methodology
1. Performed data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values and ensure data consistency  
2. Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand customer behavior across different features  
3. Applied feature scaling and used the Elbow Method to identify the optimal number of clusters  
4. Implemented K-Means clustering to segment customers into distinct groups  
5. Analyzed cluster-wise characteristics to derive meaningful business insights  

## 📈 Key Insights
- Identified high-value customers with higher spending and frequent purchases  
- Recognized price-sensitive customers with higher discount dependency  
- Discovered customer segments suitable for personalized marketing strategies  

## 💡 Business Impact
- Supports targeted marketing and promotional campaigns  
- Improves customer retention and engagement strategies  
- Helps businesses optimize revenue through customer-focused insights  

## 🚀 Conclusion
This project demonstrates hands-on experience in customer analytics, clustering techniques, and translating data insights into business value using Python.
